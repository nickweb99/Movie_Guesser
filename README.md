# Movie\_Guesser

Personal project for class



The goal of this project is to make a basic game where the user will have to guess a movie, based on a series of hints that come from the game. The user will get 5 guesses, and thus 5 hints, to get the movie correct. 



Ideas for the game:



Utilize a movie database via an api

Populate the game with a random movie at the players will

Keep track of the players record

Clear the screen at the end of each game

Make the game somewhat visually appealing (for CLI)
